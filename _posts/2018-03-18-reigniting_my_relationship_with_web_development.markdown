I started my coding journey in 2014. The year before I had left a longterm relationship and moved across the country from El Paso, Texas to New York city. The first few months were great. I was a young, single 26-year-old having fun in the big apple. 

Then reality hit. 

I was working as a digital marketing consultant and my contract ended in November. No one was hiring then, as they were getting ready for the holiday season. Plus, it was my first time experiencing a northeast winter and I became depressed. Weeks turned to months and I struggled to find work as my confidence was shot and my depression lingered on. 

During this period, bootcamp programs like General Assembly and Flatiron were sprouting up and I saw this as an opportunity to move into a lucrative career.

I started studying programming by taking courses online and signed up for the General Assembly Web Development Bootcamp in the fall.

However, when I started the program, I realized that I had not nearly prepared enough. I fell behind the very first week of the program. My brain wasn't grasping the concepts and I felt embarrassed and stupid. I came home crying every night for the next five weeks. Eventually, I made the decision to drop out of the bootcamp and switch to a part-time front-end course.

That front-end course combined with my marketing background led to a position as a Marketing Web Producer at 2U. A couple of years later, I was fortunate to get an opportunity to transition to the UX team as a UX Engineer. As a UX engineer, my interest in full-stack web development has reignited as I am experiencing first-hand, how valuable it can in solving problems, increasing effieciency and saving costs. 

This year, I signed up for the Flatiron learn.co online bootcamp, and I can confidently say, that I am no longer struggling to grasp the concepts. My relationship with web development has been rocky and slow burning, but I've finally reached a place where I feel excited to dive deep and start building.
